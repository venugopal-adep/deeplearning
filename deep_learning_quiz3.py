# Quiz questions based on the new images

    "Overfitting and Batch Normalization": [
        {
            "question": "Why are deep neural networks prone to overfitting?",
            "correct_answer": "They try to capture complex patterns in the data but may also capture noise",
            "incorrect_answer": "They are unable to capture complex patterns in the data",
            "explanation": "Deep neural networks are prone to overfitting because they try to capture complex patterns in the data but may also capture noise in the process."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is the goal of Batch Normalization?",
            "correct_answer": "To normalize the inputs of each layer to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one",
            "incorrect_answer": "To increase the complexity of the neural network",
            "explanation": "Batch Normalization aims to normalize the inputs of each layer in such a way that they have a mean output activation of zero and standard deviation of one."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is an advantage of using Batch Normalization?",
            "correct_answer": "It leads to faster learning rates",
            "incorrect_answer": "It increases the complexity of the model",
            "explanation": "Batch Normalization leads to faster learning rates since it ensures there's no activation value that's too high or too low, and allows each layer to learn independently of the others."
        }
    ],
    "Dropout": [
        {
            "question": "What problem does Dropout address in neural networks?",
            "correct_answer": "Co-dependency among neurons during training",
            "incorrect_answer": "Slow learning rates",
            "explanation": "Dropout addresses the problem of co-dependency among neurons during training, which can lead to overfitting of the training data."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does Dropout work?",
            "correct_answer": "It randomly shuts down some fraction of a layer's neurons at each training step",
            "incorrect_answer": "It adds more neurons to each layer",
            "explanation": "In Dropout, we randomly shut down some fraction of a layer's neurons at each training step by zeroing out the neuron values."
        },
        {
            "question": "What happens to the remaining neurons when applying Dropout?",
            "correct_answer": "Their values are multiplied by 1/(1-rd)",
            "incorrect_answer": "Their values remain unchanged",
            "explanation": "The remaining neurons have their values multiplied by 1/(1-rd), where rd is the dropout rate, so that the overall sum of the neuron values remains the same."
        }
    ],
    "Early Stopping": [
        {
            "question": "What is Early Stopping in neural networks?",
            "correct_answer": "A technique to stop training when validation performance starts worsening",
            "incorrect_answer": "A technique to increase the number of training iterations",
            "explanation": "Early Stopping is a technique similar to cross-validation, where training is stopped when the performance on the validation data starts worsening."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is overfitting usually reduced using Early Stopping?",
            "correct_answer": "By observing the training/validation accuracy gap during model training",
            "incorrect_answer": "By increasing the number of training iterations",
            "explanation": "Overfitting is usually reduced by observing the training/validation accuracy gap during model training and then stopping at the right point."
        },
        {
            "question": "In the figure shown, when does the model stop training?",
            "correct_answer": "At the dotted line",
            "incorrect_answer": "At the end of all iterations",
            "explanation": "In the given figure, the model will stop training at the dotted line since after that point, the model will start overfitting on the training data."
