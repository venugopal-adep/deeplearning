            "incorrect_answer": "Collect data, process data, output results",
            "explanation": "An artificial neural network works in three steps: First, it multiplies input signals with corresponding weights; second, it adds the weighted signals together; third, it converts the result using an activation function."

        },
        {
            "question": "What are the three steps of data transformation in every neuron during forward propagation?",
